# Pet-Sitter-App
A MATLAB program that simulates an app where you can hire a pet sitter to take care of your app. You put your personal information, then insert your preferences and set up the characteristics of 10 pet sitters, and an outcome will be determined based on your preference similarities with the other pet sitters (Group Project).
